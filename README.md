# DAILY DIET TRACKER

## To help users achieve their weight goal.

 This app is designed to allow the users to see a full picture of their
 calorie intake compared to their activity rate to see if they are
 **losing** or **increasing** weight. 

The app will:
- calculate the user's BMI
- calculate the user's average metabolic rate
- make calculations of how much *net gain* or *net loss* of calories the user will achieve.

Decided to create this app as it seems like something that many people could benefit from,
as I, myself, being a health-enthusiast, would like an app that would do something like this.
Having used different apps to track my own diet, calorie consumption and etc. I've never been
too satisfied with them as I've always wished that they would have this or that feature.
This is why I am attempting to create my own version of such application so that it would help
make my life more convenient when it comes to managing calories and trying to reach a specific weight goal.

However, I also recognize that people over-calculate or under-calculate the amount of calories they consume,
and sometimees people just don't think too much about how much they're eating. This often leads to
over-consumption of food, and keeping track of what one has ate often allows them to understand that
they might be eating more than they really should. This app would serve as a reminder and help the users
make logical deductions as to whether they should really *eat*, or practice more *self-control*. Therefore,
this app is being built for anyone who would like to be more smart with their dietary plans, and also for those
who desire to meet a certain weight goal. Something that may seem a bit odd, though, is that this app is being built
for desktop-application purposes, instead of being built for mobile. This is being done with the assumption that
the users would have access to a computer at any given point in time, and also allow them to be more motivated
and sincere of using the application.

As of right now, my lack of proficiency in JAVA is holding me back from creating a perfect representation of what
I **want** to build. Currently, the application is run by console-inputs, which will later be replaced by a GUI.
